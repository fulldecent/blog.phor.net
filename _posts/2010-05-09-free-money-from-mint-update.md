This is an update to <https://fulldecent.blogspot.com/2008/10/free-25-from-us-mint.html>

This is an update from the free money from the mint blog post. You are still able to collect on this offer:

1. Order $4500 in currency from the Mint, no shipping fees, no other fees
2. Deposit into bank, pay off credit card
3. Collect $45 in cash back from your card, or get a new card if you are an idiot because you don't get cash back

Now I am attaching the photo that discourages this from their site:<br>

Actually, there is another purpose here. If you can plan your cash needs in advance, this completely alleviates any need for you to use an ATM machine. Depositing checks is done via USPS mail to ING Direct, HSBC or other banks that support it. Withdrawing cash is done via this. Depositing cash is not supported. If you are cash flow positive in life, please consider choosing a profession other than selling drugs as your occupation.
