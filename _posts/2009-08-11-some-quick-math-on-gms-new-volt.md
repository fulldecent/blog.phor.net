I read about the new GM Volt and needed to inform you, loyal reader, about the numbers that are driving around. Please excuse my brevity as

Original quote:

> Using new methodology being developed, GM said it expects the Volt to consume as little as 25 kilowatt hours per 100 miles in city driving. At the U.S. average cost of electricity, a typical Volt driver would pay about $2.75 for electricity to travel 100 miles, or less than 3 cents per mile, GM said in the statement today.

Other assumptions:

- "City driving" is at 20 miles per hour. ([source](https://bit.ly/NCITq))
- The Volt is as powerful as the smallest lawnmowers: [John Deere Tractor Reference List](https://www.deere.com/en_US/docs/parts/tractor_reference_list.pdf)

Math:

25 kilowatt hours per 100 miles * 20 miles per hour in horsepower

Result:

6.71 horsepower
