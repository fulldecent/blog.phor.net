Is it possible to ruin sex with a phone call, if the person who called you is the person you're sleeping with?

This is a question I haven't thought of, but that was just answered for me.

Here is the first inquiry...

> <span style="color:blue">Anthony Romano:</span> hey<br>
> <span style="color:blue">Anthony Romano:</span> explain phone + sex + ruin<br>
> <span style="color:blue">Anthony Romano:</span> unless its too personal<br>
> <span style="color:blue">Anthony Romano:</span> but if its comical I do wish to know<br>
> <span style="color:red">Full Decent:</span> the sex is in the dream<br>
> <span style="color:red">Full Decent:</span> then that person called to wake me up<br>
> <span style="color:red">Full Decent:</span> = end sex
