    text: This still works for four of the five products. I have ordered two batches ($4500 total). I am attempting to order more and will let you know if it works.* * This is in contrast to the stated one per household limit

- Order $2,500 in $1 coins, free shipping (order 5 different coins in $500 quantity)
- Receive coins, deposit to bank, pay credit card bill
- Get 1% cash back from your credit card

Here are the items, add two each to your cart:

- [product 14598](https://catalog.usmint.gov/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&storeId=10001&productId=14598)
- [product 14590](https://catalog.usmint.gov/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&storeId=10001&productId=14590)
- [product 14589](https://catalog.usmint.gov/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&storeId=10001&productId=14589)
- [product 14588](https://catalog.usmint.gov/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&storeId=10001&productId=14588)
- [product 14596](https://catalog.usmint.gov/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&storeId=10001&productId=14596)

Do this over and over, till you max out your card. I'm not joking. Also, you'll be building your credit, by making large, on time payments with your credit card.
