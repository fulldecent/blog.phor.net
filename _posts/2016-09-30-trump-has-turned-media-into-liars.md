This is just one example of the continual stream of poor journalism related to US presidential candidate Donald Trump. I do not have an opinion on Trump and I do not defend him. However, when I dig a little deeper than just skimming the news, I consistently find that journalists are unethical or extremely incompetent when reporting him. And nearly every time this results painting a more damning picture of him.

## Exhibit one

This is the only [US government "comment"](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-russia-fbi-idUSKCN1051TD) on the theft of documents from the Democratic National Convention in 2016:

> A U.S. official involved in the investigation said that the classified information collected on the hack so far "indicated beyond a reasonable doubt that it originated in Russia."

The FBI has made no official statement regarding findings from its investigation into the hack [according to a search of their newsroom](https://www.fbi.gov/@@search?SearchableText=dnc)

## Exhibit two

This is what Donald Trump [said at the first 2016 presidential debate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/09/26/the-first-trump-clinton-presidential-debate-transcript-annotated/):

> I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.

How would you fairly and accurately make a report of the above statement? How would you explain it to the public and add insightful analysis?

## "Journalism"

Here is [how *The Economist* reported it](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21707927-first-presidential-debate-underlined-how-much-donald-trump-diverges-long-held-republican):

> ... [he] reckons that the FBI is mistaken when it suggests that Russian hackers targeted the Democratic National Committeeâ€™s computers.

What *The Economist* did was:

- Attributed a comment on deep background from "a U.S. official" to the FBI without supporting documentation
- Used a deep background comment it assumes originated with the FBI to represent a "suggestion" of DNC attack attribution
- Attributed a "[nobody] knows" comment as finding fault ("FBI is mistaken") with an organization that did not release a statement

*The Economist's* reporting here is disingenuous at best.
