This new project transmits radio on computers without radio transmitting hardware.

I am releasing it publicly now, and it is based on the recent [RAMEAR project](https://devpost.com/software/ramear).

This is (yet another) TEMPEST / exfiltration project that allows you to transmit data from an air gapped computer. The cool thing is that it works without any additional hardware, and can be received using off-the-shelf radio receivers.

Here is [the project page](https://github.com/fulldecent/system-bus-radio).
