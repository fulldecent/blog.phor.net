Anonymous post for a friend without a blog.

My thoughts? This seems like a misguided and confused statement at best and a racist one at worst. 

The main issue the author has appears to be that Hispanics are coming to America, utilizing our resources and hospitality and then not contributing their fair share to society. This is a real problem. Let us be specific. The problem to society is not other ethnicities increasing in numbers, the washing out of European ancestry, or the dilution of Judeo-Christian identity. It is certainly not clashes of cultures, or hatred. America is the largest melting pot in human history, as well as the world-renown leader in solving integration issues. 

We have had our fair share of intolerism in the past, but I'd say we're doing all around pretty well right now. 
The full quote that encompasses American freedom and acceptance is: "Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she / With silent lips. / "Give me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. / Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, / I lift my lamp beside the golden door!" What does this mean? To me, it means America accepts you, and welcomes you to come and live a free life. Many people accepted this proposition, and fled to America. 
America has welcomed foreigners for a long time. Over the years, immigrants have come from every walk of life, every political situation, and at great expense to start a new industrious life in a America.

Why do people come to America today? Is it because of religious persecution, because their home is helpless, and hopeless? Maybe. I submit to you my opinion that this is not the reason. I believe that many come for the free, high quality healthcare and the opportunity to live a comfortable life while earning wages without paying taxes. Those who give birth to a child on American soil have additional benefits. 
People that come to America for these benefits, which were designed for tax-paying citizens, and have no intention of contributing to society are not desirable. Also, American citizens, regardless of American ancestry, that are enticed to accept all these benefits with no intention of contributing to society are not desirable. In aggregate, all people, proper citizens or not, who have the intention of using America's generous benefits without contributing to society are not desirable. These people use America's valuable resources, which are in limited supply.

I conclude that America's specific problem is not open borders or people who access its generous social services—since all people, Americans and not alike, will go at great lengths to use these—but rather rich social benefits themselves.

Postscript: these thoughts apply to American policies on the federal level. States and municipalities, of course, can make decisions independently.

> "Give us your tired and poor"….. as is the inscription on the Statue of Liberty. That is how we built this country early on with the truly persecuted and those seeking a better life. This country was built by those peoples in keeping with the puritan ethic of hard work to achieve a better standard of living. The United States of America successfully emerged since the earliest days of its' arrival by growing in size and scope. Our population grew as did our borders. Today we sport a population @ 300 Million. However, the continued greatness of our country, I believe, is predicated on the fact that we are still resource-rich but not over-populated. In contradistinction, many other countries are over-populated and fighting over limited resources, This problem will become even more exaggerated as the world's population explodes.

> What we have seen in the last 50 years is a dramatic increase in our Hispanic population. By 2025, our the largest segment will in fact be Hispanic. Other ethnicities are increasing in numbers over-shadowing our traditional euro-centric population. Our european-descendant, judeo-christian identity will be blanketed by a hodge-podge of other ethnicities, races and religions. How will this demographic shift affect our nation? That is the Trillion dollar question.
>
> My contention and my concern, is as our population shift evolves, will we as America lose the concerted drive that made us great??!! As we dilute our European roots with Asians and Africans and others, what will our country look like? Will this melting pot be able to sustain itself? Will the changing demographic isolate certain populations bent on retaining their identities and principles and cause derision and disorder?
>
> Yes, the world has gotten smaller by means of enhanced communication and travel capabilities. But with those advances have come clashes of cultures, hatred and importation of terriorism to our borders. Those who have less (than us) are jealous, angry and belligerent toward us. We are seen as rich, uncaring and obnoxious individuals who take advantage of the world at large. America's cache has been diminished by our own successes!!
>
> Western Europe in many ways, mirrors what is happening in our own country. However, the changes in demographics is even more illuminating in those countries. England has a burgeoning (Eastern) Indian population. France has an incredibly large Muslim population. Germany is feeling the effects of an increasing Turkish migration. The traditional cultural and political landscapes in those countries has changed and will continue to do so.
>
> More and more, the people living in the Third World are moving to America, Canada and Western Europe. These countries are absorbing differing cultures at alarming rates. Certainly, problems with assimilation will be front-line and center. Additionally, the draw on resources, both natural and human, will create a drain on systems already taxed in many ways. Not only will water, oil, gas and electric sources be diminished but also social services will not be able to keep up with the demand (e.g. healthcare, childcare and education).
>
> We need to re-evaluate our own needs as a nation that has a proud history and potential for self-sufficiency. Do we want to continue to allow our country to be infiltrated by (illegal) immigrates? Can we support a doubling of our country's populace?? I believe that we need to effectively close our borders and get our house in order. We should work on becoming self-sufficient in terms of energy production. The other big issue is employment. Why not offer those jobs that are increasingly taken up by illegal immigrants and give them to our own (unemployed citizens). It has to be more economical to employ those Americans than to continue to drain our (tax-driven) unemployment allocated funds. Unemployed Americans are not only a drain on the system but also suffer an emotional strain, on a personal level. How about injecting and rewarding pride back into workmanship!!

> P.S. And by the way, Mr. Obama, please stop apologizing to the World for our supposed arrogance. Yes, we have made foreign relation mistakes. We are not perfect. But, we as Americans collectively have a good heart and the best of intentions. Our democracy works and allows us great freedoms that rivals the freedom of ANY other nation. We certainly do not need to apologize to China or Mexico ; they are no shining example of great humanity or humility. No one will mourn the demise of America but rest assured our absence at the world table will be sorely missed.
