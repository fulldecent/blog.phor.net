Normally, I keep the window in my room open from the top. But in an effort to hear my hot neighbors from across the street (I *think* they're hotâ€”I can't really see them, but since everyone else in this building and neighborhood is male, they pretty much win by default), I tried opening it from the bottom at ear level.

But the window doesn't stay up. So, I went outside in the rain to find a scrap piece of wood to prop it open. The only piece I could find was too long. So, I put a screw in the window frame to prop up the wood.

### The result of all this effort?

A bunch of girls singing Britney Spears' *...Baby One More Time* on a loud-ass karaoke machine. And now, I can't close the window.  
FML.
