In an embarrassing echo of "politically correct" language from the 1990's, a scientific press release illustrates why black people should be called black people:

> New FDA Nutrition Labels Will Help Consumers Choose More Wisely, Says American Heart Association...
>
> Finally, we applaud the agency’s requirement that potassium, a key nutrient, will now be listed on food labels. We know that diets high in potassium help decrease the negative impact of sodium. **This is especially true for African-Americans, who** consume less potassium, **tend to be more sensitive to sodium** and have higher prevalence of high blood pressure **than other people**
>
> <https://newsroom.heart.org/news/new-fda-nutrition-labels-will-help-consumers-choose-more-wisely-says-american-heart-association>

The faux pas here suggests that black people (even "people of African descent") have a higher sensitivity to sodium (Rosalind, 2000) but only while located in America but not, for example, Mexico. A literal intepretation of this American Health Association article could be that they are recommending to export the blacks from America to reduce their negative impact of sodium!

Here is the work cited for this AHA article:

1. Rosalind M. Peters, MSN, RN, John M. Flack, MD. Salt Sensitivity and Hypertension in African Americans: Implications for Cardiovascular Disease. MPH Disclosures Prog Cardiovasc Nurs. <mark>2000</mark>;15(4)

This Rosalind article makes the conclusion "Salt sensitivity has been found to be more prevalent in young, old, normotensive, and hypertensive African Americans than Caucasians" and it is relying on these sources:

1. Luft F, Grim C, Fineberg N, et al. Effects of volume expansion and contraction in normotensive whites, blacks, and subjects of different ages. Am J Cardiol. <mark>1979</mark>.;59:643-650.
1. Luft F, Miller J, Grim C, et al. Salt sensitivity and resistance of blood pressure: Age and race as factors in physiological responses. Hypertension. <mark>1991</mark>;17(suppl I)I102-I108.
1. Falkner B, Katz S, Canessa M, et al. The response to long-term sodium loading in young blacks. Hypertension. <mark>1986</mark>;8(suppl I):I165-I168.
1. Weinberger M, Miller J, Luft F, et al. Definitions and characteristics of sodium sensitivity and blood pressure resistance. Hypertension. <mark>1986</mark>;8(suppl II):II127-II134.

So you can see what happened full circle:

1. Scientists have accurately demonstrated differences in diet response among human races in the 70s and 80s.
1. Medical reviews in the 90s and 2000s used "political correctness" and used inaccurate wording for their publication.
1. Internet trolls in the 10s are using misquoted medical studies to influence domestic policy and support race-based deportation.
