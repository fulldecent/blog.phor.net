    text: "Hey there. You don't know me, but I found your blog because I get google alerts for my favorite band, Last Train Home, and I guess when you posted that you \"missed the last train home\", your blog got sent my way. And it made me want to say, I'm really sorry about your lousy day. Forget Kristen...what does she know? In the meantime, try this...go to lasttrainhome.com and listen to a track on the jukebox called Last Good Kiss...it's about getting one last good kiss before breaking up. It can be a new theme song! Feel better!"

So yesterday:

- Kristin and I pretty much broke up
- I missed the last train home
- Saw a terrible movie (Howard the Duck)
- And my laptop broke
