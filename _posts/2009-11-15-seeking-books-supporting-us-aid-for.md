Hello all, I am seeking a book recommendation in support (from an American's perspective) of US direct aid to Israel. The ideal book would argue that support for Israel has a positive, measurable effect on United States interests. A lame book would talk about a moral or religious case for the existence for Israel (since this is orthogonal to US national interests, and a little thing we call the First Amendment).

I will read your recommendation as a contrast to my previous book, [The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374177724/phornetandrel-20) by John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt, which I have reviewed [on my reading list](https://phor.net/booklist).
