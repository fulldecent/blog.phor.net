You're on an international flight traveling 12000 miles around the world over about 13 hours. You forgot to bring one of those neck things that the person next to you has and you can't fall asleep. You walk around, pee (even if you don't have to), talk to the attendants and finally return to your seat. What's on the in-flight entertainment center?

You could watch the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy (11 hours and 23 minutes) and then some action movies like:

Of course, this will make your eyes bleed, and you will fell jaded and have jet lag when you arrive. Instead, I recommend educational movies. Really intense math and physics on topics like:

- The general theory of relativity
- The special theory of relativity
- Differential equations and linear algebra
- The bet that Hawking lost - naked singularity
- Dark matter and its measurement
- The history of imaginary numbers, and Euler&nbsp;
- Non-cartesion topologies

That will put you sleep at least until the next meal service. I'll send this recommendation to Virgin Airlines because I hear they are pretty innovative and appreciate suggestions.
