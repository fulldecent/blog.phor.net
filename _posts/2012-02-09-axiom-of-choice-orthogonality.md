I always thought mathematicians were stupid because something like the Axiom of Choice came out years after ZFC set theory, and it is still not universally accepted. But maybe those old skeptics foresaw something like what just happened to me...

> <span style="color:blue">Su:</span> I had to tell you about the wallet I'm getting you because I found out the size and the color you want... but there's a choice for lining and there's no other way I can ask you what lining you want.<br>
> <span style="color:red">Will:</span> But there's only one option.<br>
> <span style="color:blue">Su:</span> No there's two, there's "choice" and there's "pigskin" and I don't know which one to pick.<br>
> <span style="color:red">Will:</span> Right, choice is just a word and the only choice is pigskin.<br>
> <span style="color:blue">Su:</span> So why are there two choices?<br>
> <span style="color:red">Will:</span> There's only one choice. "Choice" isn't a choice.<br>
> <span style="color:blue">Su:</span> ‚ä•
