Whitelist and blacklist are very simple words and have an unambiguous meaning. Below is a demonstration.

> I ordered a new Tesla but was underwhelmed by their lack of paint options. Their whitelist only had one choice, "Pearl White Multi-Coat".

> Gothic clothes are fun, you have a variety of things you can wear mostly black, but their blacklist is expansive and includes "dark black", "off black", "shiny black" and so much more!

Historically, there were some other meaning for these words specifically relating goodness and badness with colors. But those have been deprecated.
