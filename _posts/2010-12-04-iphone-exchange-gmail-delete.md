    text: "Yes. At this point in time there is no solution to this problem. You cannot delete emails if you have an iPhone/iPad accessing Gmail with Exchange (which is the only way to get push Gmail). You can of course access Gmail with IMAP and then be able to delete, but the annoying trade off is that you won&#39;t have push email."

When I was a kid, "delete" meant you were going to get rid of something... as in it would be gone after that. Google changes this definition. If you&nbsp;configured&nbsp;Gmail on your iPhone using Exchange with push support, the delete paradigm breaks down and instead your messages are "archived".

The solution is to create a new label called "gmailcantdelete". On your iPhone, move your messages there and then when you are on a real computer, clear out that folder all at once. Use that exact name, so Google employees can track how many users are upset about this workaround.
