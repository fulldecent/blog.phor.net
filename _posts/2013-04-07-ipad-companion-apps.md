Following are some apps that you use as a companion to apps running on a laptop/desktop computer. Companion... as in the same way you use a mouse, keyboard and monitor to use an app. No one else seems to be tracking these, so here is my list, please share if you know any more.

## Diet Coda

Desktop app: [Coda by Panic, Mac](https://panic.com/coda/)

iOS editor: [Diet Coda](https://panic.com/dietcoda/)

While you are editing code in Coda, this allows you to immediately see the changes in a dedicated preview window on the iPad.
