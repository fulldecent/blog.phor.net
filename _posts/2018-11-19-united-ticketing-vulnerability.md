## Nature of bug

It is possible to extract personally identifiable information and modify passengers' flight reservations without their permission.

Potential bug eligibility categories:

- Potential for information disclosure
- The ability to enumerate reservations, MileagePlus numbers
- Authentication bypass
- Bugs in third-party assets loaded by United-operated, customer-facing applications

Potential bug severity categories:

- Brute-force attacks (MEDIUM)
- Potential for personally identifiable information (PII) disclosure (MEDIUM)

## Steps required

1. Call the customer support number, talk to computer
2. "Find flight details"
3. From any Asian city (example: PVG)
4. Typical Asian last name (example: LIU)
5. First name: pick a letter (example: A)

Repeat step #5 for 26 times using each different letter of the alphabet.

Now you have a random passenger's confirmation number and can cancel their ticket. Or you can can pull up their flight details and ticket confirmation which includes their full name and other information.

## Tools used to discover bug

iPhone 7, Rose Gold color

## Test date

Approximately August 24th.

## Discoluser schedule

- 2018-08-24: Discovery
- 2018-08-26: Disclosure to vendor
- 2018-10-02: Vendor claims not eligible for bug bounty payment (I disagree)
- 2018-10-04: Warn vendor of public disclosure in +3 weeks
- 2018-11-20: Public disclosure

The vendor did not request an extension of the 3-week disclosure schedule. Nor did the vendor deploy a fix or provide any information about a forthcoming fix. This vulnerability is live and exploitable today.
