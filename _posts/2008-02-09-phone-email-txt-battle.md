There are a lot of ways to communicate in this day and age. I have found that some communication channels consistently produce better news than others...

My last 3 received phone calls:

>
> K S

> I had a great time last night. We should have a pajama party soon.
>
> Anonymous

> I want to have a meeting with you, and when we're done I can mail you a check.
>
> C T

My last 3 received TXT messages:

> Just a reminder, it's Mardi Gras -- girls everywhere are showing their boobs.
