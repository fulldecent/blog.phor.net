**Among the things that have kept me up at night:**

Your species is being attacked by a superior invader that takes apart peoples' brains and assimilates the knowledge into their collective hive. How do you stop them?

UPDATE 2025-07-07: And here is the correct answer.

In plain language, you just tell this to the invader:

> Our human race has knowledge and insights that are orthogonal to what you already know. This is evidenced by the fact that you are still assimilating us. But some humans, for all they know, decide to kill themselves. And while we humans all have separate consciousnesses, this afflicts only some of us. But for you, with a hive mind, once you truly understand this, you face complete extinction.
