The AIM profile riddles are back! The old rankings are still in effect. The current riddle is:<br />

<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
You are standing by a river with an 8-gallon beaker and a 6-gallon beaker, but you need exactly 5 gallons of water. Using only this how can you measure out 5 gallons?</blockquote>

For those that are new here, the profile riddle started in 2002. The rankings are listed in my profile, and occasionally in this blog. All riddles are completely original and ensured not to have answers or hints on the internet. As a result, cheating is minimized and the ranking board is a true and credible rating of intelligence.

From The Muppet Movie, 1979, which I expect is out of copyright by now.

## More riddle woes

> <span style="color:blue">Steven Shim:</span> fill the 6 gallon beaker and dump it into the 8 gallon beaker, fill the 6 gallon beaker again, and pour as much as possible into the 8 gallon, leaving you with 4 gallons in the 6 gallon beaker. dump out the 8 gallon beaker. pour in the 4 gallons from the 6 gallon beaker into the 8 gallon beaker. fill the 6 gallon up. pour it into the 8 gallon, leaving you with 2 in the 6, 8 full. so then empty out the 8 pour in the 2 into the 8. fill up the 6, and then pour exactly half of the 6 into the 8, giving you 5 mother f* gallons! beaotch! **i know you're going to say this is wrong. so f\* you!** butt f\* hard ass riddles suck! goddamn it. you'd better post up the solution when it's all done. latez. stz<br />
> <span style="color:blue">Steven Shim:</span> ok the riddle ... it's not possible, because 8x + 6y = 5 does not have a solution where you can use integers, so there is no way to get 3 or 1 gallons from the mix.... otherwise you'd be able to get 5 gallons. is this right?<br />
> <span style="color:red">Full Decent: xml asap!!!</span><br />
> <span style="color:blue">Steven Shim:</span> because the lowest common denominator is 1

And then...

> <span style="color:blue">Kevin Spier</span> fill the 8, from it fill the 6 and discard the 6 and you have 2 in hte 8.<br />
split that directly in half so you have 1 in each<br />
filll the 6 and pour all 6 into the 8<br />
fill the 6 and from it top off the 8<br />
there is now 5 in the 6<br />

Many minds are pondering this problem right now! And more importantly, Steve recognizes and ultimately surrenders to the fact that the profile riddles are a true rubric of human intelligence and wit.

## The answer
All beakers have graduation marks, so just fill either beaker up exactly to the 5 gallon mark.
