Starting the 2014 New Year's resolution early, deleting Facebook now.

Top 10 reasons to delete Facebook in 2013:

1. Now that it's so popular, people stopped posting racy or interesting content (anyone remember Webshots?)

2. Most of my real life friends, on Facebook, are just posting commercial advertisements with their personal account

3. Back when it was called The Facebook I made an auto-friend virus (anyone remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samy_(computer_worm)" target="_blank">Samy&nbsp;on MySpace</a>) and still can't remember which friends I know in real life

4. You are the product, and the personal information collection is getting extreme (you are being targeted not just based on clicking "I am married" but based on patterns of things you do on the internet that they see which indicate you are married)

5. Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/385569904840341" target="_blank">asking for government ID</a> to use your accounts
6. I miss talking to people on the phone
7. The only authentic content on Facebook is complaining, and there is too much complaining
8. Only old people use it

And also, I just tried to create a business account to move over my business pages. They removed this ability from their website because they prefer you to use your personal account which can collect personal information. I called them on the phone (the number you get if you're a paid FB advertiser) and the guy was a total dick.

So, friends I'll be calling you more in 2014 to stay in touch. And a question, what is the new way to waste time online?

P.S. Deleting FB is a process, you can't actually just click a button. Get started early if you want to do it for New Year's
