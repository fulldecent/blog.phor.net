Happy New Year, and good luck on having a safe and happy 2014.

**If you are a victim of rape or aggravated assault indoors:**

❌ Don't yell "rape"
✅ Yell "fire"

Sadly, few people want to help a rape victim and walk into an icky situation. Many people wont think twice about breaking down your door and risking their life to help a fire victim.

**If your life is in danger and you call 911**

❌ Don't say "please send help"
✅ Say "officer assist, shots fired"

Yes, police will respond to help you if you are being attacked by someone or an intruder with a gun is walking in to your house. But 10 police will respond if they believe another police officer is in danger. Bonus tip: you may go to jail for doing this, make sure it is worth it.

**If you are robbed on the street**

❌ Don't yell "he took my purse"
✅ Yell "he gotta gun"

"He took my purse" is *your* problem and probably wont get immediate help. "He gotta gun" and you pointing at the guy is *everyone's* problem, will get many people looking at him and probably an expedient camera phone picture. Also, after everyone has shut up and is looking at the guy, *then* you can say "he took my purse". No one will fault you for mistaking a gun. And with adrenaline rushing it will be more likely someone helps you.

## Stuff you can do right now

**Email yourself a photo of the front and back of everything in your wallet**

How are you going to cancel your credit card when it's stolen? How much easier is it to prove your identity when you have a copy of your driver's license and ID number? Will you remember everything in your wallet if it is gone?

**Email a copy of your cell phone's IMEA number to yourself**

On iPhone this is *General -> About -> scroll down -> IMEI* and then to take a screenshot press the power and home buttons simultaneously. It will be faster to report to police and your phone company if you have this information. Also save a copy of serial numbers for anything else expensive you have that is mobile.

**Make a copy of your house and car keys**

And put them somewhere accessible without needing your keys. Also put $100 there.

**Write a $100 check towards your credit card bill**

You'll be $100 closer to debt free.
