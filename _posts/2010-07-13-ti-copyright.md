From the BA II Plus calculator manual:

> When you choose the chain (<b>Chn</b>) calculation method, the calculator solves problems in the order that you enter them. (Most financial calculators use <b>Chn</b>.)

> Using <b>AOS</b>(TM) (algebraic operating system), the calculator solves problems according to the standard rules of algebraic hierarchy, computing multiplication and division operations before addition and subtraction operations. (Most scientific calculators use <b>AOS</b>.)

In other words, TI is trying to trademark PEMDAS.
