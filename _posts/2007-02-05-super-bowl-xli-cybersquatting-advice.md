I saw the Super Bowl this weekend and I know some people tape the game so they can watch it when they get home, so I'm writing a quick spoiler to make those people upset.

* The Colts—scored a bunch of points
* The Ravens—scored a few points
* Combos - <a href="https://www.man-mom.com/Video.aspx">won the game</a>

Actually I don't even know if the Ravens were playing this game. Actually I don't even know if the Ravens are a football team.

*Update 2012-02-12*

Combos can afford \$2 million in air time for a commercial, but can't pay \$40 to register a domain name for 4 years.
