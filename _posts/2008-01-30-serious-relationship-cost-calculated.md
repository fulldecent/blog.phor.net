John's wisdom never goes out of style:

> I calculated how much it costs to have a serious relationship.

> How did you calc this

> When you get older you need to make money. I'm going to need to make atleast $300,000 to live decently. I think I can make that when I'm 35 or 40.<br>
> I could see myself getting comfortable at $150k, but that might get boring after a while. Hell, I'm complacent now and I only get $65k, but that's not gonna last.
