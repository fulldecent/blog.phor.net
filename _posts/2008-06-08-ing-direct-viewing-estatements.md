eStatements are a great proposition for companies: save money on a low-value service provided to clients that is legally required.&nbsp;Making eStatements more usable will reduce banks' postage costs and save customers money. Unfortunately, banks focus on revenue, not customer service or saving cost. Let's look at ING's execution:

Some problems and possible fixes focus on the fact that most customers still expect paper statements and you need to make a compelling case to get buy-in. Also, since money's at stake, don't let your message get diluted:

- Remove unrelated links: grade us, advertisement for CDs
- Show statements on the page directly
- Tell customers whether they have viewed a statement or not
- When files download, save them with a filename that is useful
- Digitally sign the statement
- Post quarterly statements

Here is the proposed new version!
