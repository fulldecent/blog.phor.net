If you come home this weekend, perhaps you could give me some advanced I Pod lessons. Like, how to turn it on. What it does. How to wear the earphones. I haven't used this thing at all.<br />
Love, Mom<br />
> <span style="color:blue;">Mom:</span> Hey, how did you get my email into the IM. Manually, or some type of hacker trick that automatically converts emails to IMs?<br />
> <span style="color:red;">Full Decent:</span> No, when you get something funny you want to tell everyone, you put it as your away message - then everyone can see it<br />
> <span style="color:blue;">Mom:</span> So, I'm a laughing stock. I see how it works now. Careful, or I'll put your nude baby photos on my website.<br />
> <span style="color:red;">Full Decent:</span> ulth<br />
> <span style="color:red;">Full Decent:</span> you have a website?<br />
> <span style="color:blue;">Mom:</span> Ha! Ha! Ha! No, that was just a joke. I can't even turn on the Ipod, remember?
