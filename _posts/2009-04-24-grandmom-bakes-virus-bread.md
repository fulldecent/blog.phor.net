I thought chain mail was a recent phenomenon. Meet friendship bread.

Friendship bread is the email forward of yesteryear. First you receive the "friendship bread" from someone who "cares about you". This bread only lasts for 10 days and then goes bad. The idea is that you have to take this bread and work it into an ingredient in your own bread which takes 10 days to fully prepare. At the end, you have a yield of two times the original amount of bread. These bread spawn must be given to other "friends" who are now obligated to continue the forwarding, or else. If the chain is broken, the bread goes bad and nobody wins.
