Back in June 2008, someone posted this advertisement on Craigslist:

> 4 months old, male, very friendly and sociable, especially to young kids. If you're interested in this friendly lil fella, call Will at 267-\*\*\*-\*\*\*\*.
>
> ![Puppy](/assets/images/2009-01-29-awesome-craigslist-prank.webp)

This was a great prank. My phone was off when it was posted. When I turned my phone on, I had 20 voicemails and over the next 2 hours, my phone was literally ringing off the hook.

You can listen to some of the voicemails:

- [John wants a puppy](https://phor.net/media/vm1.mp3)
- [Johanna wants a puppy](https://phor.net/media/vm2.mp3)
- [John wants a puppy](https://phor.net/media/vm3.mp3)
- [Meg wants a puppy](https://phor.net/media/vm4.mp3)
- [Jackie wants a puppy](https://phor.net/media/vm5.mp3)
- [Vanessa wants a puppy](https://phor.net/media/vm6.mp3)

I never figured out who posted this message, but I suspect it was Kristin Bello (or maybe Megha) because I don't know anyone else who could pretend to use the word "fella."
