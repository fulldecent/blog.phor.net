The Philadelphia government watchdog website [*hallwatch.org*](https://hallwatch.org/), maintained by Ed Goppelt, was shut down in February 2009. A new website, [Hallwatch 2](https://hallwatch2.org/), looks to take its place. Hallwatch 2 aspires to make it easy to stay informed about Philadelphia civics by bringing visitors to the latest information. There is also a subscription service for Philadelphia tax records, deed information, and other real estate records, but information about that is scarce at this time. It will be a long time before Hallwatch 2 reaches its stated goal of becoming "the new Hallwatch," especially in terms of Ed Goppelt's success in suing and getting records from the city and bringing the whole community together.

You can find the latest updates in Philadelphia civics from [Ed Goppelt on Twitter](https://x.com/#!/edgoppelt).
