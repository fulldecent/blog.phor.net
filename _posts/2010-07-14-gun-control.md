### The scam email

### The follow-up email

> Glad you replied back to my email. My phone has been stolen by the muggers. I have nothing left on me, and I'm grateful to God that I still have my life and my passport, 'cause it would have been worse if they made away with my passport. All I need is 1,450 pounds. You can have it wired to me via Western Union.

### The solution

You call your local patriot friends, get in the car, and handle the situation.

Of course, there are no patriots in the UK, which is why the scams are taking place there.
