Here is my top 5 foods list in no particular order, this is a life-long work in progress.

## Grandmom's baked macaroni and cheese

Probably very similar to all the other mac & cheese recipes out there... except that my Grandmom makes it better than yours and that's a fact.

- **<a href="https://www.shereepunjab.com/">Shere-e-Punjab</a>—Chicken Makhani**
  - _208 W State St, Media, PA 19063-3113_
  - It's spicy chicken but comes with the smooth aftertaste of creamy/light sauce.

## <a href="https://www.tropicana.net/">The Tropicana</a>—Beef noodle soup

- _2831 Boardwalk, Atlantic City, NJ_
  - The best in class. This is not Hong Kong style noodles where you have to chew them like beef jerky. These noodles are thin and compliment the strong soup, one of a kind!

## <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qfcB">Tortillas Restaurant</a>—Enchiladas

- _634 York Rd, Willow Grove, PA_
  - I like the mushroom flavored beans with crab enchiladas. But feel free to try the other flavors. Also, there are bonus points for the restaurant's decoration (which is rare because I don't even care about stuff like that) and also the complimentary chips/salsa and margaritas on request.

## <a href="https://villanova.edu/">Second Storey</a>—Buffalo chicken panini

- _800 Lancaster Ave, Villanova, PA 19085_
  - You need to ask for this specific combination by request, but basically it is a buffalo chicken pizza folded in half with special panini spices on the outside.

## :-$

All of these restaurants are best-in-class. Starting today, if you find a better substitute for any of these items and bring me to the food, I'll include your dish and name on the list. If you know anything about Will's famous favorite-5-foods list, you know that this is a hell of a lot of publicity.
