Please use the terms "Joe Sixpack" and "free beer" in a sentence that explains how Joe righteously denounces the giveaway to seek something even freer.

Beer, and software, are a meritocracy. The ideology is just one of the merits (for some, but not all).

Therefore, I propose a new term that makes this apparent:

**Free as in cheap**
