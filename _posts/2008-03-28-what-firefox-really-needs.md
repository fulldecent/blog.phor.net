Firefox has been lying to you. They keep increasing their version numbers... but nothing is happening. The main selling point for Firefox 3 is "it's fast... just like we used to be". Here's a table:

| Marketing hype | Actual version |
|----------------|----------------|
| Firefox 0.9    | Firefox 0.9    |
| Firefox 1      | Firefox 1      |
| Firefox 1.5    | Firefox 1.1    |
| Firefox 2.0    | Firefox 1.2    |
| Firefox 3.0    | Firefox 0.9    |
| Firefox 4.0    | **Firefox 2.0 (hopefully)** |

Firefox is not worthy of going past the 1.x version until there is innovation. I submit that this is the feature that will mark the beginning of the 2.0 browser era:
