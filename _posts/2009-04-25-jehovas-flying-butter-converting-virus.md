Usually you should blog with one topic per post. But I am just so excited with news today that I am going to burst!

Update to [virus bread](./grandmom-bakes-virus-bread): here is the updated process:

1. Get bread starter.
2. Spend ten days to turn bread starter into 4 bread starters.
3. Spend standard bread baking time to turn one bread starter into one bread.
4. Distribute remaining bread starters as follows: 2 to "friends", one to self

End result, you have your bread and eat it too.

Su doesn't know the difference between butter and cheese.

2009 is declared a complete waste for me! The Jehovas Witnesses came to my house today and I completely failed to convert their religion*. I prepare all year for this day, and I have the whole dialog in my head ready to go. BUT there is one critical failure: JW only come early in the morning on a weekend, and I am unable to have rational discourse so early in the day! Maybe in 2010, sigh.

*I maintain that I can take any religious person and convert them into a baseline human (or a crying, sobbing, confused mess) by using only the Socratic method. However whether or not this is a noble cause is still a matter of my ethical development. Naturally, it goes with saying that Jehovas witnesses are asking for it.

I am buying a box of 500 nylon frisbees imported from China. Now I will NEVER run out. Hopefully I can choose the importer and have them delivered in time for the pool party.
