Here is a website I wrote that provides an independent analysis of SEPTA's regional rail performance.

You can specify the period to consider.

Also, the site provides a recommended new schedule in order to avoid systematic latenesses which have been identified.

Enjoy!

## Additional notes 2009-06-01

All of this data was collected from SEPTA [trainview](https://trainview.septa.org/). I created a script to query that page every minute, running since October 2008.

The recommended schedule changes are the new train schedules for each line which I think will cause the minimum inconvenience to passengers and the current scheduling engineers:

* The schedule is moved to match the actual arrival times of trains
* Passengers know when to actually expect the train to arrive

There's a little more math than that, actually. You can contact me for details.
