Part of my own new year's plan was to set a professional mission (inspired by Musk's "Die on Mars") and organize my time to getting towards that. Here's the mission:

{: .margin-note}
This is quantifiable ("most" is > 50%) and I hope clear enough. Missing a deadline.

> Verify seller claims & authenticity for most things you buy

Overall, this represents projects I am focused on: verifying halal/kosher food with QR codes. And then extending this religious focus on what food people eat into a fanatical verification of other things we buy. Getting into NFTs, I started by studying the pharmaceuticals industry and intellectual property licensing. There is a lot to improve there in terms of fraud and verifications.

Organizing my time, consulting with my wife, I will choose event appearances based on impact. Accept clients that align with this mission. And try to be more public/open with projects I am working on to have more impact. One result is the new NFT/Web3 Community Service Hour. As people reach out with questions about technology for the future, we guide them in this public forum to discuss. This helps me instead of replying to many detailed emails during the week. And it keeps me accountable for the one hour I promise everybody that I'll be available.
