    text: "Good to know that you got a traveling plan to China~!^^<br /><br />Since I had my undergrad study at Beijing Languages and Culture University(BLCU) where exactly the HSK test is held, I was quite familiar about the test.<br /><br />I checked the website, there are three levels of HSK available: Basic; Junior & Middle; Senior. When you say Beginner Level,I take it as Basic level..<br /><br />However, there are only two tests for Basic Level this year: One on April 18th, 2009, the other one on Novemebr 28th, 2009. I am not sure if you are gonna make it...As for Junior & Middle Level, the closest one is on Octomber 18th, 2009.<br /><br />Besides, I know some guy named 'Jeff Barnes'. He goes to Drexel too and he had spent 4~5 years studying Chinese at BLCU. I believe  he was actually taking the HSK exams..You can find him on facebook or probably you knew him already.:-)<br /><br />I will see what else I can find..<br />Feel free to let me know anything I can be of any help.<br /><br />Best,<br />Emmy"
