The [European Data Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52022PC0068#article-30) codifies requirements for smart contracts.

However, based on its broad definitions, this seems to also apply to entire blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the entire blockchains themselves.

Even calculator.exe that comes with every Windows computer and Calculator.app on MacOS since System 6 and now macOS, these all seem to be affected.

These applications would all be required to have backdoors which allow shutdown of the application and removal/safeguarding of data.
