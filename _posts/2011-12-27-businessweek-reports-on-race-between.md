Because the way our presidential voting is set up, only two candidates can have a chance. Getting points on the board for the first state is a big advantage. Following is the situation today in Iowa.

First place -- Ron Paul
Second place -- Newt Gingrich
Third place -- Mitt Romney

Here is how the headline reads [from Businessweek](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-12-27/romney-gingrich-iowa-campaigns-intensify)

> Romney-Gingrich Iowa Ground Campaigns Intensify in Last Days

By leaving out the leading candidate in this headline, the article is misleading. Further, given the importance of media in our elections, this misleading article is abusive. This was written by Lisa Lerer and is pathetic.
