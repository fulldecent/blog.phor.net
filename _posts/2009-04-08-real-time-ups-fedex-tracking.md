    text: "Thanks for the heads up. I would have never thought about tracking cell phone usage. But now we're on the subject. Here's a feature request. Let the customer sign up for a txt notification when the package is within $X miles from their house. This could allow them to prepare to receive the package. Or in my case, living in an apartment where I can't hear a knock on the front door, this would prevent UPS from making 3 failed delivery attempts for anything I order. In fact, this info could be put on the \"we missed you\" card."

    text: Fuck yes Will E., I agree with you 100% even if it would cost a customer an extra fee to get the gps tracking, it would well be wrth it. ive been waiting three days for a new pair of sktes from Ohio and i live in PA so its not such a long way but my package whent down to pitsburg and only now is coming up my way, i would feel much more content about waiting if i knew where exactly this truck is, but over all ups is a prety dependable postal service, just could use some improvments... Peace out from PA :D

request? My stuff "shipped" But fedex just say "received shipping<br>
information", UPS can't even find my tracking number, but Amazon has<br>
more up to date info and USPS only updates daily.<br>

> Presumably they know what planes this stuff is on, why not allow live<br>
flight tracking? and truck GPS and what not. Clearly expensive, but I<br>
feel like they should already have GPS in all their trucks and planes<br>
already, just a matter of aggregating and internetifying. Even if it<br>
interpolates via java script, something like at 11am the plane took<br>
off, given a landing time of 2pm, it is now noon, the plane is 1/3 of<br>
the way to landing, and so on. Would be awesome.<br>

Amazon Prime, and I would like to find 4 other people to split it with<br>
me.

And here's why not...

> <span style="color: red;">Operator</span>: I just called the driver, he stopped to go to the bathroom.<br>
> <span style="color: blue;">Teenager</span>: That's bullshit, I can see he just stopped 20 minutes ago.<br>
> <span style="color: red;">Operator</span>: The driver tells me he has diarrhea.<br>

Post in the comments if you just don't care and STILL want GPS tracking of your package.
