Recessions make people smart... the hard way. This concept really permeated my head recently when I saw two poster advertisements:

1. on i76 eastbound after 30th street station: Ever had leprocy? Thanks to animal research, you haven't. Researchsaves.org
1. on the 5:18pm R3 Elwyn: Are you good without God? Millions are. Phillycor.org
