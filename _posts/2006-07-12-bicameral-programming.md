1. You're writing software and do the interface part first:

   ```html
   <a ... "?action=revert">click here to revert</a>
   ```

2. You go to add in a `revert()` function to your photo class

3. But realize that you already did it months ago when drinking... thinking, oh I'll probably need this later.
