Quote of the week 2009-12-19

> SW: Why do so many FOBs get attracted to religion when they come here? After someone is twentysomething years how can they still be tricked like that?<br>
> WE: I think it is because they have weak minds<br>
> SW: I think they get tricked into coming to the meetings for the free food
