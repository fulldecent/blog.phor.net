I got ksmserver compiled, thanks to a few changes by Lubos! And the advice here http://kopete-qq.blogspot.com/2006/06/howto-upgrade-to-head-kdelibs4.html helped me get rid of my segfault.

Currently I get the runtime fatal error:

> Could not register with D-BUS. Aborting.

This is making progress.
