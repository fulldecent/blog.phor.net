Looking for a job is an involved process everywhere in the world, lots of applications, lots of interviews, and if you meet the employer's expectations, lots of offers.

This whole process can take lots of time and would be really unfortunate if you prepared hours for an interview and then realized that you didn't get the job because you were black, or Jewish, or Irish (or all three!).&nbsp;In America there are rules to even the playing field -- the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In the East, they use other ways to avoid last minute discrimination let downs.<br>
