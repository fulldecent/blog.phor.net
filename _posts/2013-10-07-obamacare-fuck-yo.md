Q: What's the best part about Obamacare?

A: You still have 84 days until it happens.

Here is the [homepage for Obamacare](https://healthcare.gov/) [parody] talking about the possible higher rates and risks of applying.

Of course who wants to make helathcare as efficient as the DMV? I went to dial their main customer service phone number.

And then realized... there's something magical about this number. It spells FUCK YO.

Of course you can always still get the best local vanity number for yourself without FUCK YO in it. See the other post about [how to get vanity numbers for free from Google Voice](https://privacylog.blogspot.com/2009/08/full-google-hack.html).
