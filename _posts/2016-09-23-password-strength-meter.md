This post is a reply to <https://x.com/18F/status/778637006075154432> it shows two great user interfaces you can use on your website to show the visitor how strong their password is.

## Version 1

Create a Password

Password: <input>

Password-strength meter:

<span style="color:red"><b>POOR</b>: Anything you type in the that box is a poor password. We will make you change it periodically and we tell you not to use this password on other sites, but you will do it anyway.</span>

## Version 2

Choose a new password:

Please select your new password from one of the choices below:

- `c7b73bc3915d8c55bfba45ae`

<span style="color:green"><b>EXCELLENT</b>: We know nobody will ever randomly guess this password because we just randomly made it. If you intended to remember this password, don't, you need a password manager.
