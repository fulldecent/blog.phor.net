I have been trying to get involved in the FICS project, the largest and oldest free online chess server. After playing for many years there, maybe there is something I can give back.

It would be nice to know more about their organization and who the real people involved are. Even though there are so many people actively playing there, information about the project is sparse and dated, and I can't get in contact with any admins via email. Investigating further, I have the following to share.

The entity that owns and operates the FICS (or used to) is Free Internet Chess Organization, a Minnesota corporation. Their original address was:

<address>P.O. Box 3212<br>Burnsville, MN 55337 USA</address>

While operating out of

<address>13306 Court Pl<br>Burnsville MN 55337 USA</address>

But is now

<address>8708 31ST Ave N<br>New Hope Mn 55427 USA</address>

Originally the FICS was registered as a non-profit on 1998-07-31, however the entity has been dissolved as of 2007-01-16 according to the State of Minnesota.

So, at this point donations are not tax deductible.
