Sing a new song a nice big song<br>I got one in mine for you<br>So tell me what to do-oo<br>

Power of the poor is getting stronger<br>Day by day, hour by hour<br>Minute by minute<br>That's the power of the poor

Growing quick and fast<br>and all different ways<br>And many different sines<br>That's the power

> "New Poor"<br>Harry McCloskey<br>Some time in the early 90's we'd like to forget
