A majority (all?) of emails that Google sends are not compliant with CAN-SPAM legislature in the United States. Following are some examples. I have mailed a letter to the legal department and my direct legal contacts at Google and have no response. Is this the class-action lawsuit we need to make the big players out there take responsible email sending seriously?
