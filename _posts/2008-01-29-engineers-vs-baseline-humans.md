Q: How is being an Engineer different than being a baseline human?

A: You get emails like this:

> From: "Chris Nolan" &lt;@@@&gt;<br>
> To: "William Entriken" &lt;@@@&gt;<br>
> Subject: copper line power<br>
>
> what prevents someone from using the idle line voltage on telephone line to power non phone related lower draw devices? like alarm clock and what not, for the free power?<br>
> <br>
> Could I somehow plug a UPS into the phone line(with an adapter) to steal power?
