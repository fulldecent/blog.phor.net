[20 Questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions) is a game of deductive reasoning that gained popularity in the 1940s, notably through a successful radio show of the same name.

## Gameplay

- One player, the "answerer," thinks of a subject that should be familiar to common people.
- The answerer answers all questions with "yes" or "no."
- The other player(s) ask questions to guess the subject, winning if they guess it without exceeding 20 questions.

## Inspiration and evolution

Inspired by [20q, the game by Radica](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SKLREA?ie=UTF8&tag=phornetandrel-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000SKLREA), I have developed a more sophisticated computer program called 19 Questions, featuring an improved mathematical model utilizing likelihood and entropy, rather than neural networks.
