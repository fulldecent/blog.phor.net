Here is a paper I wrote a while back in 2003 and wanted to publish to a math magazine:

[Smaller discs to cover the unit circle](assets/2009-06-02-smaller-discs-to-cover-unit-circle.pdf)

[MathWorld cites the best known solutions](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiskCoveringProblem.html) for n=9 as 0.422 and n=10 as 0.398. My solution is better with n=9 as 0.414 and n=10 as 0.381.

Just when I finished, I looked around for more references and related work, after MathWorld and all those sources. Well, it turns out that two other people:

- D. Nagy, *Fedesek es alkalmazasaik*, M.Sc. thesis, Eötvös Loránd Univ., Budapest, 1974.
- S. Krotoszyski, “Covering a disk with smaller disks,” *Studia Sc. Math. Hungar.*, vol. 28, 1993, pp. 277–283. MR 95c:52035.

both had published the same solution I came up with. Really, who would spend the time to solve such an esoteric problem? Nerds!
