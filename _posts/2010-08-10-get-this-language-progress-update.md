So I got this Chinese newspaper delivered to my house, 人民日报, $26 per
year, delivered daily, yes really.

So I started staring at the words on the page and, I'm not even making
this up, one of the articles made sense. It was talking about Beijing
opera and how this classical theatrical form is being re-popularized
though introduction to children in primary school.

So this is a big in-your-face to Wen-Yen, who said I wouldn't be
reading newspapers within three years of my Chinese self studies!
