Did you ever sing in the shower just get a few extra bars out while you're alone?

That's basically what happening with this blog. I write essays to myself to help collect and organize my thoughts.

Writing it out is also a really nice way to put an end to a project... or maybe just a chapter in a project?

So that's why I'm writing this. And you are welcome to connect on any of these thoughts if we've struck a chord.

Here's where I get some of my inspiration for writing:
