    name: John Archibald
    text: I received an email from LinkedIn, which I had never heard of or cared to remember if I had heard the name before. It was an invitation from an individual with whom I had important on-going legal business. I clicked on a link that opened a LinkedIn web page where I was asked to set-up an account. I cautiously began to enter login info and some personal profile info but decided not to continue as I really didn't want to supply some of the info that was being asked of me, so I backspaced and deleted all field entries without submitting anything and then closed the web page. Minutes later I received an email from LinkedIn welcoming me as a member and asking me to login and complete the profile questions. This time the page had names and photos of people that are according to them LinkedIn members  that I have listed in my outlook contacts folders. I feel as if I have been raped and can sympathize with William Entriken and his plight. Where are the authorities who are supposed to protect us from predators like LinkedIn? or are there any? I unsubscribed by not logging in using the password that I had typed and deleted with out submitting, but by getting a temporary password by clicking on "I forgot my password", logging in with it, and finding the link to delete the account that I never submitted information for I deleted the account.  It was a nightmare and my world has changed as does some ones life who has been forcibly raped. I also documented the emails and web pages as I encountered them and will be looking for an opportunity to take legal action in the future. The funny thing is the individual who was supposedly inviting me says he got one from LinkedIn informing him I was inviting him.

Did you ever sing in the shower just get a few extra bars out while you're alone?

That's basically what happening with this blog. I write essays to myself to help collect and organize my thoughts.

Writing it out is also a really nice way to put an end to a project... or maybe just a chapter in a project?

So that's why I'm writing this. And you are welcome to connect on any of these thoughts if we've struck a chord.

Here's where I get some of my inspiration for writing:

- <https://xkcd.com> — There's a lot that goes into these. If I could be more succinct, this is what most of my essays and Tweets would become. But in general I see a profound sense of wonder, analysis and humanity in these comics. These are also my guides, so when I'm writing about things I'm studying then they are my guides for writing.
- <https://theoatmeal.com/comics/reaching_people> — This is a great warning of why the creators of the world need to continue being the publishers of the world.
- <https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/> — This is an inspiration for how this page is laid out.

**And also a note about the security and privacy posts on this blog.**

I have experience designing, testing, breaking and fixing websites. On the web, there are  egregious failures in privacy, security, and user interface.

Instead of complaining to companies, writing reports to the SEC, and opening lawsuits, the best options are to offer consultation services and document what you've found in public.

All reports here are original research unless noted otherwise.

Cheers,<br />
