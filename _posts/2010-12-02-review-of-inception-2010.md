## Summary

Like *Avatar*, with guns, and a less believable premise.

## Differences

### Multi-line story and character development

The story attempts to earn the "thinking man's movie" title by employing multiple (though diminutive) concurrent storylines. This approach fails when its ridiculous premise is revealed. Only one character is developed through a step-by-step narrative.

### Movie genre pitfalls

Movies with a ridiculous premise and complex plots often fail for a specific reason. They have a limited supply of surprise or disbelief capital. *Inception* spent its entire capital on introducing the premise and a couple of artifacts. Once the story started, there were potential opportunities for character development or unexpected twists, but after using up its capital, the movie couldnâ€™t risk alienating the audience. The story included numerous loops and multiple storylines but lacked effective use of them, resulting in a linear plot. Interest spikes only at the end when the story resolves, suggesting the entire movie might occur inside a dream, as implied by the spinning top. However, due to the lack of time for character development or surprising twists, the audience has no basis to support this speculation (e.g., a team member being a plant could suggest why the top continues spinning).

### Artifacts and loops

- **Artifact**: An element introduced just to be used once, like the never-ending staircase used during the hotel chase. The Babysitter is filled with artifacts. This concept likely has an official name.
- **Open Loop**: A narrative level that is entered and then exited, such as each dream level in *Inception*. Other examples include going on a trip and then returning. This is a shift in context, and there probably is a specific term for it.

### Perspective on drug use

The entire story can also be interpreted as a tale about drug use. This perspective may be clearer to someone familiar with heavy drug use.
